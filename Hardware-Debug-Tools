SigDigger: SigDigger - A free digital signal analyzer
SigDigger is a Qt5 digital signal analyzer written in C/C++ that runs in GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows. Unlike existing alternatives, SigDigger is not based on GNU Radio. Instead, it uses its own DSP library (sigutils) and a realtime signal analysis library (Suscan) that exploits multicore CPUs to distribute load. 
Also, SigDigger supports most SDR devices in the market thanks to SoapySDR. Sigutils, Suscan and SigDigger are software libre, licensed under the terms of the General Public License version 3.
